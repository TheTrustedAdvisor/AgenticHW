netmiko>=4.6.0          # SSH-based device management (Python 3.13 compatible, no telnetlib)
Jinja2>=3.1.2           # Template engine for configuration generation
PyYAML>=6.0.1           # YAML parsing for inventory and configuration

# SSH and Security
paramiko>=3.3.1         # Low-level SSH with key management
cryptography>=41.0.0    # Cryptographic operations

# Testing Framework
pytest>=7.4.2          # Testing framework
pytest-cov>=4.0.0      # Test coverage

# Data Validation and Utilities
cerberus>=1.3.4         # Schema validation
ipaddress              # IP address manipulation (built-in)

# Development and Debugging
black>=23.0.0          # Code formatting
flake8>=6.0.0          # Code linting

# Phase 1 Note: napalm excluded due to Python 3.13 compatibility issues
# Phase 1 Note: ansible excluded to avoid VSCode crashes during installation
# These will be added in Phase 2 when compatibility is ensured

# DO NOT ADD: napalm (incompatible with Python 3.13)
# DO NOT ADD: ansible (causes VSCode crashes during installation)
# DO NOT ADD: textfsm (dependency of napalm, also problematic)
